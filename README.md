<h1>Tic Tac Toe on vanilla JS</h1>
<p>I used Object-Oriented-Programming approach in creating the game, namely Classes in JS</p>
<p>The first version was via functional approcah, but then I decided to redo it using Classes, thus enhancing my knowledge of classes, in ES-6, private and protected properties.</p>
